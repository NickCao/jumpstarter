# Getting Started

Jumpstarter provides a CLI called `jmp`, you can use it to manage your connected
hardware, write tests, setup your cloud environment, and develop custom drivers
for your hardware.

The CLI tool is available as part of the `jumpstarter` Python package. 
You can learn how to install this package [here](../installation/python-package.md).
