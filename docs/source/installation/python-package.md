# Python Package

The `jumpstarter` Python package contains everything you'll need to get started
with Jumpstarter.

This package includes:
- A client library.
- A CLI tool.
- An exporter runtime and built-in drivers.

The Python package can be installed using ``pip`` or similar:

```bash
$ pip install jumpstarter
```

```{tip}
This will install the `jumpstarter` package globally, when using Jumpstarter
as a library, it is recommended to install the package in a virtual environment
instead.
