# Local Kubernetes Cluster

If you want to play with the Jumpstarter Controller on your local machine,
we recommend running a local Kubernetes cluster on your development machine.

```{warning}
We do not recommend a local cluster for a production environment such as a lab.
Please use a full Kubernetes installation either on-prem or in the cloud.
```

There are several tools to run a local Kubernetes cluster on your computer. 
We recommend using either **kind** or **minikube**.

See the following documentation to learn how to install and setup a local cluster:
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
